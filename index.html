      The clarinet is a fairly old instrument, invented around the year 1690 by Johann Christoph Denner. It was based on an earlier instrument called the chalameau. However, the chalameau didn't have a very high range;
      it couldn't play very high notes. So, Denner added the "register key" that was a key that let out air near the top of the instrument and allowed it to play higher notes. <br><br>The clarinet itself is a long, usually
      wooden cylinder, with holes cut out for air to escape, in order for players to be able to change the pitch of the instrument.
